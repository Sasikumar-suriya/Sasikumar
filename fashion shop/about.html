                Hi there! My name is Sasikumar, and I am the owner at <mark style="font-weight: bold;">Fashion Stop</mark> Online Boutique (shopimpressions.com). I am a wife to the greatest guy in the world, mother to three blue eyed babies, and living in my hometown of Fayetteville, AR. I love tacos, a good glass of wine, and am a firm believer that leopard print is the perfect neutral.
I launched my website in 2012 with a passion to create a one of a kind shopping experience. I had a strong desire to create a site where women of all ages, shapes, sizes and budgets could find their dream outfit. Not just the perfect dress, but the shoes, earrings, and purse needed to make it the outfit of your dreams. I knew I wanted to create fashion that was obtainable to everyone, because I believe that a woman's outfit strongly impacts how they feel. Everyone deserves to feel beautiful, and that is what I sought to create.
We currently have a staff of 41 employees (growing daily!), including my husband that selflessly left his mechanical engineering career to help grow the company alongside me. I am so thankful for what I get to do each and every day, and the team we have in place that I consider family is what makes our company the success that it is today. I am blessed by our staff immensely, and am so proud to call them mine!
Thank you for taking the time to get to know me a little bit. You being here, on my site, means more to me than you will ever know. Whether you are a first time customer, a loyal long term customer, or simply just window shopping, I am so glad you are here. I hope you will allow us the opportunity to impress you!
